abstract = {There has been some controversy regarding the uncertainty of measurements of thermal properties using differential scanning calorimeters, namely heat capacity of liquids. A differential scanning calorimeter calibrated in enthalpy and temperature was used to measure the isobaric specific heat capacity of water and aqueous solutions of cesium chloride, in the temperature range 298K to 370K, for molalities up 3.2mol·kg−1, at p=0.1MPa, with an estimated uncertainty (ISO definition) better than 1.1%, at a 95% confidence level. The measurements are completely traceable to SI units of energy and temperature. The results obtained were correlated as a function of temperature and molality and compared with other authors, obtained by different methods and permit to conclude that a DSC calibrated by Joule effect is capable of very accurate measurements of the isobaric heat capacity of liquids, traceable to SI units of measurement.}

abstract = {The calculation method for the effective latent heat of fusion of ice in aqueous solution was proposed, in order to clarify the amount of heat generated by the melting of ice in ice slurry. In this study, the effect of the temperature of the aqueous solution on the effective latent heat was investigated. As a result, it was clarified that the effective latent heat of fusion of ice in ethanol solution is significantly affected by the temperature of the solution, thought not so significantly for propylene glycol and ethylene glycol solutions. Additionally, the specific heat of ethanol solution near the freezing temperature was measured, since there are insufficient data for our investigations. Moreover, the investigation to estimate the effective latent heat near the freezing temperature was carried out.}
